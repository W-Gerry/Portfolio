    I love programming and creating new projects, but being a software developer isn't everything. Sometimes it's good to get away from coding and screens, to enjoy everything else the world has to offer. As a Cornishman at heart this mostly involves ice cream, surfing and the great outdoors. This page has got a little more about who I am outside of development, I love sharing my hobbies so hope you enjoy.
